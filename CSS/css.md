** What is CSS? **
* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
 * CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media

 ** Why Use CSS? **
* CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

# CSS Solved a Big Problem:

* HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

* HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

* When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
