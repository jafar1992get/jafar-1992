** Revisions and the Cloud **
# history the cloud :
* Millennials may feel like cloud computing is something from their generation, but the truth is that it actually traces its roots back over 60 years. Since the 1950s, organizations have been using an increasingly complex and ever-changing system of mainframe computers to process their data. In the early days, mainframe computers were huge and prohibitively expensive.

* Before beginning this tutorial, it is highly recommended that you have a solid understanding of the Terminal (for Mac) or Command Line (for Windows and Linux).

- In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control.

# Snapshots

* Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

# Local Operations

* Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. This allows for process expediency because a project’s history resides on the local disk, eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.

# Tracking Changes

* Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.
