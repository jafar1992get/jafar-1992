# Logic Gates used in Digital Computers

# intiredution and inichalayzer :
* Binary information is represented in digital computers by physical quantities called signals. Electrical signals such as voltages exist throughout the computer in either one of the two recognizable states. The two states represent a binary variable that can be equal to 1 or 0.

* For example, a particular digital computer may employ a signal of 3 volts to represent binary 1 and 0.5 volt to represent binary 0. Now the input terminals of digital circuits will accept binary signals of only 3 and 0.5 volts to represent binary input and output corresponding to 1 and 0, respectively.

** What are Gates? ** 
- Binary logic deals with binary variables and with operations that assume a logical meaning. It is used to describe, in algebraic or tabular form, the manipulation done by logic circuits called gates.

* Each gate with more than one input is sensitive to either logic 0 or logic 1 input at any one of its inputs, generating the output according to its function. For example, a multi-input AND gate is sensitive to logic 0 on any one of its inputs, irrespective of any values at other inputs.

** The various logical gates are: ** 

AND
OR
NOT
NAND
NOR
XOR
XNOR

** AND Gate** 
The AND gate produces the AND logic function, that is, the output is 1 if input A and input B are both equal to 1; otherwise the output is 0.

** OR Gate **
The OR gate produces the inclusive-OR function; that is, the output is 1 if input A or input B or both inputs are 1; otherwise, the output is 0.

** NAND Gate **
The NAND function is the complement of the AND function, as indicated by the graphic symbol, which consists of an AND graphic symbol followed by a small circle.
