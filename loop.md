** Loops in JavaScript **
* Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. For example, suppose we want to print “Hello World” 10 times. This can be done in two ways as shown below:

* Iterative Method

** Iterative method to do this is to write the document.write() statement 10 times.**

# Using Loops

# In Loop, the statement needs to be written only once and the loop will be executed 10 times as shown below:

* filter_none

<script type = "text/javascript"> 
var i; 
  
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)  
{ 
    document.write("Hello World!\n"); 
} 
< /script> 
# Many things may seem confusing to you in the above program at this point of time but do not worry you will be able to understand everything about loops in JavaScript by the end of this tutorial. You can observe that in the above program using loops we have used the document.write statement only once but still, the output of the program will be same as that of the iterative program where we have used the document.write statement 10 times.
