# JavaScript is used to access any content in HTML.:

# You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example: 
* Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element • 
* Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements .
* Change the size or position of an <i mg> element .

# Before you can run code examples with JavaScript on your computer, you may need to change your browser’s security settings.
# Spacing displayed by a browser in a web page is determined by the HTML5 elements used to format the page .
* Often, JavaScripts appear in the <head> section of the HTML5 document 
* The browser interprets the contents of the <head> section first 
* The <script> tag indicates to the browser that the text that follows is part of a script. Attribute type specifies the scripting language used in the script—such as text/javascript

** The script Element and Commenting Your Scripts **

# The type attribute specifies the MIME type of the script 
as well as the scripting language used in the script—in this case,
 a text file written in javascript .
